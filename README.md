# clean-earth-project
Join the Clean Earth Project and help restore our planet! This community-driven app lets you upload photos of areas needing cleanup and mark them on an interactive map. Spot littered or polluted locations, raise awareness, and collaborate with others to make a difference. Together, we can build a cleaner, healthier world!
